 **-- data types --**

 * there are two types of data we use our daily life.
 1. numeric data
 2. character type data / alphabetic type of data

 * numeric data types - ex: 23, 43.22
 we already know that, computer use binary system to represt a number, so how computer represent decimal number. that's why we need a differnt data type for decimal value. so, we can call, there are two types of numeric data type.

 1. integer
 2. floating

 * character type data - ex: 'c', 'car'
 1. single character
 2. collection of characters


 ** primitive data types **
 1. primitive
 2. user defined
 3. derived data type

 * see screen shot for details

 ** two types of modifiers
 1. unsigned
 2. long


 * unsigned only use with integer and character. it means only positive value.
 * long only use with integer, when we use "long int" it will take double byte , ex: if "int" takes 4 bytes then "long int" will take 8 byte. and long float take 10 byte. because, float takes 4 byte and double takes 8 byte. so, if we need more byte, then we have to use long float.

 ** we can't perform mod operation in float number

 **-- increment /decrement operator --**

 * a = ++i;  - pre increment means, first increment and then assing the value.
 * a = i++ - post increment means, first assign the value and then increment the value.

 **-- enum & typedef --**

 * enum = it is use for programmer, when we need a group of constants then we can use enum - ex: enum days {mon, tue, wed, thu, fri, sat, sun}; 
 * typedef = it is use for code readability. ex: typedef int marks; marks m1 = 20;
